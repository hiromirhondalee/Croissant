    <h1>🥐 Croissants 🥐</h1>
    <p>
      The original croissant was called Kipfel and originated in Austria in
      1683. It was created in honor of the Austrian victory over the Turks and
      modeled after the crescent on the Turkish flag. (Some historians say the
      croissant originated in Hungary).

      🥐 August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing
      the croissant to France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in Paris.
      (Some say it was Marie Antoinette who brought the croissant to France…)
      <br />
      <br />
      🥐 The earliest French reference to a croissant he found was among the
      “fantasy or luxury breads” in Payen’s Des substances alimentaires, 1853.

      🥐 January 30th is National Croissant Day.
      <br />
      <br />
      🥐 The Croissant became the French national product in 1920.
      <br />
      <br />
      🥐 The Croissant started as a luxury product, but by the end of the
      nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred a good
      brioche).
      <br />
      <br />
      🥐 Before the modern croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or
      shell, not to eat on its own.
      <br /><br />
      🥐 The chocolate croissant is actually called painauchocolat, as it
      is not in the shape of a crescent. 
      <br /><br />
      🥐 In 2013, chef Dominque Ansel came up with the cronut. It is a
      deep-fried croissant/doughnut combination that became all the rage at his
      New York bakery.
